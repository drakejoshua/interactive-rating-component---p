## My process
Firstly had to mark up the whole html and then applied a stylesheet. Then i added some javascript as it helped in saving the user's rating.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Javascript ES6 ( no frameworks )

### What I learned

i just learned that two or more elements can have the same grid names ( how funny?! )

### Continued development

I want to build better things not only design
